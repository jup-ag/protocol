**RPC** (Remote Procedure Call) refers to a protocol that allows external applications, such as wallets or trading interfaces, to communicate with the blockchain network. This communication enables users to access blockchain data, submit transactions, and execute commands remotely, facilitating seamless interaction with the decentralized exchange functionalities provided by the AMM DEX platform like **Invariant**.

Selecting the appropriate RPC endpoint is crucial for ensuring seamless communication with the Solana blockchain network, allowing you to access blockchain data, submit transactions, and interact with the **Invariant** platform efficiently.
