Blockchain networks come in many forms. These networks serve a variety of purposes, including testing, development, experimentation, and specialized applications. Invariant offers support for a wide range of these networks:

- **Mainnet** - The Mainnet is the primary and official Solana blockchain network where real transactions and operations occur. It's the live network where users can interact with decentralized application, trade tokens, and transfer assets.

- **Devnet** - Devnets, or development networks, are similar to testnets but are specifically intended for developers to build and test applications in a controlled environment.

- **Eclipse** - [Eclipse](https://eclipse.invariant.app/) Network is a secure, high-performance Layer 2 (L2) blockchain network built on Ethereum, leveraging Solana Virtual Machine's (SVM) parallel processing for unmatched speeds, Ethereum's validating bridge for security, Celestia's data availability sampling for scalable verification, and acting as a shared platform for various applications to achieve cross-application composability.
